You may ask, what is C++ and why should I learn it? Let&#39;s see what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B\">wikipedia</a> has to say on this -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>\n<p>It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers and performance-critical applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got some idea of what we&#39;re dealing with, let&#39;s jump straight into the course. This course has been divided into several units (which get progressively harder) which again are divided into several chapters like the one you&#39;re currently reading. Each chapter will introduce some new concept which might require some exercises marked with TODO: you must complete to move forward. Other features will be introduced as we move ahead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comments\">Comments</h2>\n<p>This chapter introduces comments in c++, which are of two types - Single line comments and multiline comments. Single line comments start with 2 slashes which look like <code>// This is a comment</code> and are valid till the end of line. Multiline comments, as the name says extend to multiple lines and start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. Here&#39;s an example that depicts use of both -</p>\n<pre><code>// This is a single line comment\n\n/* And this one is\nmultiline comment*/\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"todo\">TODO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert the multiline comment inside the editor to single line comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To pass this chapter, you must be able to submit the program on right side with required changes by pressing submit button on the bottom. Watch out for errors in the bottom panel.</p>\n<p>Hint: you can resize everything on this website :)</p>\n"},{"name":"chapter-2","result":"Hello World!\n","files":{"header.hpp":"/*\n  This is chapter 2\n*/\n","main.cpp":"#include <cstdio>\n\nint main() {\n    // use puts() here\n}\n"},"readme":"<p>This is still under construction, but lets use puts() here.
