**Welcome to Learnyoucpp!** Along this journey you'll learn to write c++ programming language and understand its applications and best practices. We assume you're already familiar with some programming in general and want to learn or get upto date with recent changes in C++. A lot has changed since the advent of _Modern C++_ but the essentials of language are still preserved. Let's see what creator of C++ has to say on it -

> C++11 feels like a new language. I write code differently now than I did in C++98. The C++11 code is shorter, simpler, and usually more efficient than what I used to write.

> _- Bjarne Stroustrup_

This course is divided into several units which are again divided into several chapters. Each chapter tries to focus on a specific feature of this language and provides challenges that you can complete in order to get familiar with those features and understand more about this language. The aim for this unit is to get you familiar with the language without diving deep into the details. We'll start with the most minimal program in C++ -

## Main
The program on the right defines a function called _main_ which takes no arguments and does nothing. Every C++ program must contain exactly one global _main_ function which gets executed right when you run your executable. The braces `{` & `}` mark the beginning and end of _main_ function and keyword `int` specifies the return type of your function. We'll read more about functions in later units.

### TODO

* Execute the program by pressing compile button on bottom right of your screen!

**PS**: you can resize everything on this website so try playing out with layout and adjust accordingly :)
