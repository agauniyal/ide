Comments are essential feature of a programming language and are used to annotate source code so that its easily readable by other programmers working on same code as yours. C++ offers two types of comments which are pretty common with other programming languages as well -

* Single line comments
* Multi line comments

Single line comments start with 2 slashes `//` and extend till the end of line. Anything you write after them is not visible to the compiler till a new line is encountered. Multi-line comments, as the name says, extend to multiple lines and start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They are often used to describe documentation of functions,classes,... and other constructs of languages.

### TODO

* For this chapter you just need to convert the multiline comments to separate single line ones.
